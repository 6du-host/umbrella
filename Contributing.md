# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! Developing Umbrella is quite easy:

1. Install grunt if you didn't have it
2. Run `grunt watch`
3. Modify any file within `/src` (code, tests or documentation)

After these steps, the library, tests and documentation will be automatically joined. To see the tests open `/test/index.html` in your browser.

Please try not to make a PR with broken code
