# Umbrella JS

> Note: this documentation is autogenerated from the files in src/

Lightweight and intuitive javascript library. A simple example:

```html
<a class="example button">Click me</a>

<script>
  u('form.example').ajax(function(err, data){
    if (err) u(".error").html("There was an error");
    u('button.send').html("Send again, " + data.name);
  }, function(){
    u('button.send').html("Sending...");
  });
</script>
```

## Getting started

There are few ways to add it to your system. But you can also just play with it in jsfiddle.

### Play with it

Instead of installing it, you can just play with it in JSFiddle:

[<button class="icon-jsfiddle">Try on JSFiddle</button>](https://jsfiddle.net/franciscop/mwpcqddj/)



### Use a CDN

JSDelivr is an awesome service that hosts many open source projects so you don't need to even download the code:

### Use bower

Bower is a front-end package manager that makes it super-easy to add a new package:

```
bower install umbrella
```


### Download it

If you like it or prefer to try it locally, just download `umbrella.min.js`:

[<button class="icon-download">Download Umbrella JS</button>](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umbrellajs/umbrella/master/umbrella.min.js)

Add it to your project:

```html
<script src="umbrella.min.js"></script>
```



## u()

Find nodes from the HTML with a CSS selector:

```js
u('ul li')
u(document.getElementById('demo'))
u(document.getElementsByClassName('demo'))
u([ document.getElementById('demo'), document.getElementById('test') ])
u('li', context)
```



### Parameters

The first parameter can be:

- A text CSS selector
- A single HTML Node. This is specially useful in events where you can just pass `this`
- A NodeList or other similar objects that can be converted to an array
- An array of nodes
- Nothing

The second parameter is only for the CSS selector, which indicates a portion of the DOM where the selector is applied. For example, with `u('li', u('ul').first())` it will find all of the `li` from the first `ul`.


### Return

An instance of Umbrella JS so you can chain it to any of the other methods.



### Examples

Select all of the list elements that are children of `ul`

```js
var lis = u('ul > li');    // Same as u('ul').children('li');
```

Find all of the headers from the page to create a Table of Contents:

```js
var headers = u('h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6');
```

It plays well with other libraries, including jquery. For example, with [pagex.js](http://github.com/franciscop/pagex):

```js
// When we are on the page "/login"
page(/^login/, function(){
  
  function done(err, res){
    if (err) return alert("There was an error");
    window.location.href = "/user/" + res.id;
  };
  
  // Find the form and handle it through ajax when it's submitted
  u("form.login").ajax(done);
});
```
